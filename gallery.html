        A lot of defects can be effectively visualized and corrected in the frequency domain.
        This gallery explores a couple of them.
        In all examples the image on the left is spatial domain image and the image on
        the right is the magnitude of its Fourier Transform. They were obtained using the
        <b> Save Image &amp; Transform </b> command. More noisy images can be found
        inside the
        <a href="http://imgur.com/a/B3zw2#0"> Input Album</a>
        and their corresponding corrected versions in the
        <a href="http://imgur.com/a/w6iOb#0"> Output Album</a>


    </h3>
    <h2> Coherent Noise </h2>
    <h3>
        Coherent Noise causes periodically repeating defects in the image. This can be
        caused by elecrical equipment interfering with the camera sensors. These photographs
        were captured by <a href="https://landsat.usgs.gov/science_L7_cpf.php"> Lansat 7
        ETM+ </a>. More information can be found on Landsat's page on <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov/science_an_cn.php" >
        Coherent Noise </a>. Similar images can be found using <a href="http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/" >
        Earth Explorer</a> and selecting the <b> L7 ETM+ SLC-off </b> data set.

        The image exhibits a grid of black dots littered over majority of its area.
        The noise is manifested into the frequency domain by extra(except the centre) sharp peaks in the
        frequency domain.

        The image exhibits a similar defect as the last image. Notice the similarity
        in the placement of peaks in the frequency domain. This points towards
        the same source contributing to noise in both the images.

    <h2> Moiré Pattern </h2>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern">Moiré Patterns</a>
    are observed in a variety of places, one of them is on printed media. It is usually
    the result of halftone screens of insufficient density used during printing.
    The following 2 examples, attempt to correct Moiré patterns seen in scanned photographs.

    <img class="img-centre" src="/images/ex3_in.jpg" />
    <div class="caption"> <h5>
        The Moiré pattern on the image is clearly visible. The corresponding artifacts
        on the frequency domain image are the peaks observed in a circle around
        the centre.

    <div class="caption"> <h5>
        Zeroing out the peaks visibly reduces the Moiré pattern. This could also
        be achieved with a band reject filter.

        The Moiré pattern is evident on the face of the cartoon. Since the image
        was scanned from the same magazine as the last one, the position of peaks
        in the frequncy domain is similar
