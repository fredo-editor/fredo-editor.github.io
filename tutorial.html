    <h1> Walkthrough </h1>

    <h2> Launch </h2>
    <p>Start Fredo Editor with the <code> fredo </code> command in your shell.</p>

    <h2> Opening an Image </h2>
    <p>Select the <code> File > Open</code> menu to load an image. Currently
    <b>.jpg</b>, <b>.bmp</b>, <b>.png</b> formats are supported.</p>

    <img src="/images/tutorial/open.jpg" class="img-centre"  />

    <h2> View </h2>
    <img src="/images/tutorial/view.jpg" class="img-centre"  />
    <br/>
    <p>Opening an image displays it and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform">
        2D Discrete Fourier Transform.</a>
        The transformhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV
     is shifted such that the highest frequency component is at the centre.
     To compute the the fourier transform, the image is first internally converted
     into the <b>YUV</b> color space. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV">YUV</a>
     space, the <b>Y</b>
     component represents the intensity and is used to compute the Fourier Tranform.
     Since the result of the Fourier transform is complex, only its magnitude is
     visualized on the right hand side. Within the magnitude, the peaks
     are several times grater than the rest of values. To effectively visualize it,
     we plot the <b>log</b> of the magnitude, instead of the magnitude itself.
     </p>

     <h2> Brush </h2>
     <p> Selecting the <code> Edit > Brush </code> menu opens the configuration options
     for a brush.</p>
     <img src="/images/tutorial/edit.jpg" class="img-centre"  />
     <br/>
     <p>Currently only a <b>Square Brush</b> is supported.</p>
     <img src="/images/tutorial/brush.jpg" class="img-centre"  />
     <br/>
     <p> The size slider allows the user to change the width of the brush and each change
         is immediately reflected in the preview section. The <b>Value</b> spinbox
         modifies the value of the brush. It means that, on a click, the brush will
         update all pixels in the frequency domain image contained within it to
         the selected value.
     </p>

    <h2> Editing </h2>
    <img src="/images/tutorial/fft.jpg" class="img-centre"  />
    <br/>
    <p>After selecting a brush, hovering over the frequency domain image generates
    a green preview of it. In addition to the mouse position (top-left) a secondary
    preview is shown in the diagonally opposite (bottom-right) quadrant. This
    is because, the Fourier transform of real images is symmetric about the centre.
    To maintain the same consistency, the brush also performs symmetric edits.
    Clicking on the frequency domain image with the brush applies it, and the
    spatial domain image immediately reflects the change. When a brush is applied
    only the magnitude of the fourier transform is affected, the phase remains the
    same. Since the fourier transform was derived from the <b>Y</b> component of
    the image, it is the only component affected. This means that only the intensity(Y)
    of pixels will change, the colour(U and V) will remain the same.
    </p>

    <h2>Saving </h2>
    <p>The only <b>.png</b> format is supported for saving images.
    The <code> File > Save Image </code> option will save only the modified
    spttial domain image.</p>
    <img src="/images/tutorial/save.jpg" class="img-centre"  />
    <br/>
    <img src="/images/tutorial/out.jpg" class="img-centre"  />
    <br/>
    <p>The <code> File > Save Image & Transform </code> option will save the spatial
    and frequency domain images side-by-side.</p>
