## What is FreDo ?
FreDo-Editor (**Fre**quency **Do**main Editor) is an application to edit images in their frequency domain. It
transforms images into frequency domain with the 2D
[DFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform), allows modifications
in the frequency domain and gets the image back by using the inverse transform.
Just like MS-Paint, Photoshop, GIMP allow editing images (spatial domain), FreDo
Editor allows modifications in the frequency domain. Just as how we can view
the number 1482, in binary (10111001010) and ocatal (2712), the fourier transform gives
us a different perspective of the same data, with some very useful insights.

## How is it useful ?
The main purpose of Fredo-Editor is to help visualize the frequency domain image
transformations. The frequency domain is very helpful in removing periodic/coherent noise is images. It can also be used to help design frequency domain filters.

## Where do I report bugs or feature requests ?
